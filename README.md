# Introduction to Computer Vision. Project
The final project for Intro to Computer Vision, Innopolis University

The idea is described in the final report, but long story short: this project is aimed at providing a feedback on how accurate one performs a physical exercise. The experiments include images and videos. For each experiment, you get an accuracy score (0-100%) and human keypoints. The examples below are taken from the report _ICV_Final_Report.pdf_.
